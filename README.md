# ES2D7 Mass-Spring Damper System

*A simple MATLAB app that displays the response of a mass-spring damper system*

## About the Project

This was a short project where the user is able to enter a variety of parameters including:
 - Mass in kg
 - Spring Constant in Nm^-1
 - Damper Co-efficient Nsm^-1
 - Height of Step Input in N

This will then display a step response within the app along with an animation of the system\

## Usage

Requires MATLAB and the Systems Modelling Toolbox}
